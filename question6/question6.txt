A store wants to have an inventory management application where the owner/store manager can login and see inventory 
of the store.
As a manager of the store, I should be able to see name of the accessory, quantities ordered, 
quantities remaining, vendor name, purchase price per item, selling price per item, date and time when 
the item was added, date and time when the item was updated. 
I should also be able to add a new accessory, update existing accessory and delete an accessory. 
Also a new manager should be able to register/login in the app. 

Expectations: 
	a) I want to see register/login in html page. 
	b) A manager should be able to see details of accessories in tabular format using jinja. 
    (If needed you can ask for template from us)
	c) create/update/delete should be just apis with not frontend. We can call them using postman.
	d) A working flask app with working apis.
